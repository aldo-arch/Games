themessage[12]="Hey, George, I was wondering...if you're not doing anything tonight...um, would you wanna see a movie?"
themessage[13]="Do you sleep on your stomach, George? Can I?"
themessage[14]="I never thought I could love someone I didn't know...but you have proved me wrong."

themessage[16]="You are seriously the nicest guy I have ever known. The way you make me feel is just out of this world."
themessage[17]="Was your father a terrorist, George? Because you da bomb."
themessage[18]="It's almost like you control my words, that's how much power you have over me..."
